Simple Discord Moderator Bot

I have coded a simple moderation bot, including a kick, ban, and unban command. 
I may update it in the future to contain a mute and unmute command

List of commands:
!kick - Kicks the mentioned user.
!ban - Bans the mentioned user
!unban - Unbans the user based on ID
!mute @user - Mutes the user based on a role labeled "Muted"
!unmute @user - Unmutes the user based on a role labeled "Muted"
!welcome - Welcomes a new user
!command - Displays commands
