Simple Discord Moderator Bot

I have coded a simple moderation bot, including a kick, ban, and unban command. 
I may update it in the future to contain a mute and unmute command

List of commands:

!kick - Kicks the mentioned user. - Usage: `!kick <@user>`

!ban - Bans the mentioned user - Usage: `!ban <@user>`

!unban - Unbans the user based on ID - Usage: `!unban <@userID>`

!mute @user - Mutes the user based on a role labeled "Muted" - Usage: `!mute <@user>`

!unmute @user - Unmutes the user based on a role labeled "Muted" Usage: `!unmute <@user>`

!welcome - Welcomes a new user - Usage: `!welcome`

!commands - Displays commands - Usage: `!commands`

!shutdown - Turns off your bot. - Usage: `!shutdown` // CHECK LINE 32! PUT YOUR OWN DISCORD ID IN THE EMPTY QUTOES

!ping - Tells you your ping - Usage: `!ping`

!clear - Clears messages in the chat. - Usage: `!clear <amount>`
